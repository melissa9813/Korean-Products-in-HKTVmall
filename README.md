# Korean-Products-in-HKTVmall


Project Overview

With K-pop's big splash in Hong Kong, more and more Korean products are recently observed in both offline and online Hong Kong markets recently. However, whether Korean products were actually being actively purchased by Hong Kong consumers remained uncertain. This project analyzes the status of Korean products in the Hong Kong market by crawling HKTVmall, one of the most popular Hong Kong online shopping malls.
